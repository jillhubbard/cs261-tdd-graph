# You Don't Know Graphs

But after this, you will.

In this assignment, you will engage in a test-driven development process to
implement a graph. We'll call it a "Graph."

## Run the Test Suite

Run the tests:

`python3 -m unittest test_graph`

Open the test and implementation files (eg *test_graph.py* and *graph.py*) in your editor of choice. Modify the implementation to pass the first test. After each test passes, create a commit. Then, uncomment the next test, and re-run the test suite. Implement what's necessary to pass the test, and then repeat this process.

**But wait!**

Toward the middle of the test suite, you should be thinking about the algorithmic efficiency of each operation. What should be O(1)? What should be O(|E|) or O(|V|)? In addition, try to implement your operations using recursion, whenever possible.

## Best Done in Pairs!

Get together with a friend in front of just one machine, and take turns being the driver. Change drivers after each test is passed. Don't forget to commit after each test.
